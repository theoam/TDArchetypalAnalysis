## R Script: Archetypal Analysis on data sets

- Windows 10 was used as the primary operating system.
- R version: XXX

After running the R script and conducting the Archetypal Analysis on the data sets, we obtained the RData image for each examined system.
These RData images were imported in the TD Benchmarker tool (<https://github.com/theoam/TDBenchmarker>).
